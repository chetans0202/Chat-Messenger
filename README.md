# Chat Messenger with Peer-to-Peer Communication

A chat application that allows peer-to-peer communication, developed using Java Socket Programming. The application enables users to send and receive text messages in real-time, ensuring direct communication without a server.

## Features
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct communication between two users without the need for a central server.
- **Real-time Chat**: Text-based messaging with immediate transmission between users.
- **Message Logging**: Maintains chat records periodically for later reference.
- **Platform-independent**: Can run on different platforms due to the use of Java, ensuring broad compatibility.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java Socket Programming** (for peer-to-peer communication)
- **Java** (for application development)
